Hi! I'm Jaskirat.

I'm pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering, along with minors in Electrical Engineering, set to graduate in 2027. I love building robust, Python applications (delving into Rust now!) and diving into research areas like Spiking Neural Networks and neuromorphic computing at [Emerging Devices & Systems Lab (EDSL)](https://sites.google.com/iitgn.ac.in/edrl/home), and automata theory. My academic journey includes hands-on projects in quantum mechanics simulations, hardware (FPGA Basys3) implementation of JPEG compression, and leadership in our college's astronomy club [Odyssey](https://www.instagram.com/odyssey_astronomyclub/). 

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring research opportunities in Theory of Computation, specifically automata theory.
