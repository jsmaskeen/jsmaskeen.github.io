      "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic the human brain and are useful for tasks like pattern recognition with low energy use. Using RRAM crossbar arrays helps simulate synaptic weights and supports analog signal processing. However, standard two-terminal RRAMs struggle with simultaneous reading and writing, since reading uses low voltage and writing uses high voltage. To solve this, a 3-terminal Pr₀.₇Ca₀.₃MnO₃ (PCMO) RRAM is proposed. Two terminals are used for writing, and the third is used for reading, allowing real-time, asynchronous operation. This reduces circuit complexity and speeds up learning in SNNs."
